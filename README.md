# GBrain

The memex Vannevar Bush imagined, built for people who think for a living.

## How this happened

I was setting up my [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.com) agent and started a markdown brain repo. One page per person, one page per company, compiled truth on top, append-only timeline on the bottom. The agent got smarter the more it knew, so I kept feeding it. Meetings, emails, tweets, Apple Notes, calendar data, original ideas. One thing led to another. Within a week I had:

- **10,000+ markdown files** indexed and searchable
- **3,000+ people** with compiled dossiers and relationship history
- **13 years of calendar data** (21,000+ events)
- **5,800+ Apple Notes** going back to 2009
- **280+ meeting transcripts** with AI analysis
- **300+ captured original ideas** organized by thesis
- **500+ media pages** (video transcripts, books, articles)
- Company profiles, food guides, travel logs

This is what I actually use day to day. The agent runs while I sleep... literally. OpenClaw's dream cycle (DREAMS.md) scans every conversation from the day, enriches missing entities, fixes broken citations, and consolidates memory. I wake up and the brain is smarter than when I went to sleep.

**You don't need Postgres to start.** The knowledge model is just markdown files in a git repo. The [skills](docs/GBRAIN_SKILLPACK.md) and [schema](docs/GBRAIN_RECOMMENDED_SCHEMA.md) work with any AI agent that can read and write files. Start there.

I added Postgres + pgvector later because at 1,000 to 10,000 long markdown docs, `grep` stops working. You need real chunking, real retrieval, real search. GBrain is the thin CLI and MCP layer I built on top of Postgres to solve that, optimized for OpenClaw and smart agents.

### Ask it anything

> "Who should I invite to dinner who knows both Pedro and Diana?"
> — cross-references the social graph across 3,000+ people pages

> "What have I said about the relationship between shame and founder performance?"
> — searches YOUR thinking, not the internet

> "What changed with the Series A since Tuesday?"
> — diffs timeline entries across deal and company pages

> "Prep me for my meeting with Jordan in 30 minutes"
> — pulls dossier, shared history, recent activity, open threads

Your markdown repo is the source of truth. GBrain makes it searchable. Your AI agent makes it live.

## Why Postgres

At 500 files, `grep` is fine. At 3,000 people pages, 5,800 Apple Notes, and 13 years of calendar data, `grep` falls apart. You need keyword search for exact names, vector search for semantic meaning, and something that fuses both. You need an index that updates incrementally when one file changes, not a full directory walk. You need your agent to find "everyone who was at the board dinner last March" in milliseconds, not 30 seconds of grepping.

GBrain gives you hybrid search that combines keyword and vector approaches, plus a knowledge model that treats every page like an intelligence assessment: compiled truth on top (your current best understanding, rewritten when evidence changes), append-only timeline on the bottom (the evidence trail that never gets edited).

AI agents maintain the brain. You ingest a document and the agent updates every entity mentioned, creates cross-reference links, and appends timeline entries. MCP clients query it. The intelligence lives in fat markdown skills, not application code.

## The Compounding Thesis

Most tools help you find things. GBrain makes you smarter over time.

The core loop:

```
Signal arrives (meeting, email, tweet, link)
  → Agent detects entities (people, companies, ideas)
  → READ: check the brain first (gbrain search, gbrain get)
  → Respond with full context
  → WRITE: update brain pages with new information
  → Sync: gbrain indexes changes for next query
```

Every cycle through this loop adds knowledge. The agent enriches a person page after a meeting. Next time that person comes up, the agent already has context — their role, your history, what they care about, what you discussed last time. You never start from zero.

An agent without this loop answers from stale context. An agent with it gets smarter every conversation. The difference compounds daily.

Never do anything twice. If you look someone up once, that lookup lives in the brain forever. If a pattern emerges across three meetings, the agent captures it. If you generate an original idea in conversation, it goes to `originals/` — your searchable intellectual archive.

└──────────────────┘    └───────────────┘    └──────────────────┘
```

The repo is the system of record. GBrain is the retrieval layer. The agent reads and writes through both. Human always wins — you can edit any markdown file directly and `gbrain sync` picks up the changes.

## What a Production Agent Looks Like

The numbers above aren't theoretical. They come from a real deployment documented in [GBRAIN_SKILLPACK.md](docs/GBRAIN_SKILLPACK.md) — a reference architecture for how a production AI agent uses gbrain as its knowledge backbone.

**Read the skillpack.** It's the most important doc in this repo. It tells your agent HOW to use gbrain, not just what commands exist:

- **The brain-agent loop** — the read-write cycle that makes knowledge compound
- **Entity detection** — spawn on every message, capture people/companies/original ideas
- **Enrichment pipeline** — 7-step protocol with tiered API spend
- **Meeting ingestion** — transcript to brain pages with entity propagation
- **Source attribution** — every fact traceable to where it came from
- **Reference cron schedule** — 20+ recurring jobs that keep the brain alive

Without the skillpack, your agent has tools but no playbook. With it, the agent knows when to read, when to write, how to enrich, and how to keep the brain alive autonomously. It's a pattern book, not a tutorial. "Here's what works, here's why."

## How gbrain fits with OpenClaw

GBrain is world knowledge — people, companies, deals, meetings, concepts, your original thinking. It's the long-term memory of what you know about the world.

[OpenClaw](https://openclaw.com) agent memory (`memory_search`) is operational state — preferences, decisions, session context, how the agent should behave.

They're complementary:

| Layer | What it stores | How to query |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| **gbrain** | People, companies, meetings, ideas, media | `gbrain search`, `gbrain query`, `gbrain get` |
| **Agent memory** | Preferences, decisions, operational config | `memory_search` |
| **Session context** | Current conversation | (automatic) |

All three should be checked. GBrain for facts about the world. Memory for agent config. Session for immediate context. Install via `openclaw skills install gbrain`.

## Try it: your files, searchable in 90 seconds

GBrain doesn't ship with demo data. It finds YOUR markdown and makes it searchable.

**Act 1: Discovery.** GBrain scans your machine for markdown repos.

```
=== GBrain Environment Discovery ===

  ~/git/brain (2.3GB, 342 .md files, 87 binary files)
    Type: Plain markdown (ready for import)

  ~/Documents/obsidian-vault (180MB, 1,203 .md files, 0 binary files)
    Type: Obsidian vault (wikilink conversion available)

=== Discovery Complete ===
```

**Act 2: Import.** Your files move from the repo into Supabase.

```bash
gbrain import ~/git/brain/
# Imported 342 files into Supabase (1,847 chunks). Embedding in background...

gbrain stats
# Pages: 342, Chunks: 1,847, Embedded: 0 (embedding...), Links: 0
```

**Act 3: Search.** The agent picks a query from your actual content.

```bash
# The agent reads your corpus and picks a relevant query
gbrain query "what do we know about competitive dynamics?"
# 3 results, scored by hybrid search (vector + keyword + RRF fusion)

# 30 seconds later, embeddings finish:
gbrain stats
# Pages: 342, Chunks: 1,847, Embedded: 1,847, Links: 0

# Now semantic search is live too
gbrain query "what are our biggest risks right now?"
# Finds pages about moats, board prep, and strategy -- by meaning, not keywords
```

Your file count will be different. Your queries will be different. The agent picks them based on what it imported. That's the point: this is YOUR brain, not a demo.

**The compounding effect.** Search for Pedro. The agent pulls his page, his relationship history, his company. Next time Brex comes up in conversation, the agent already knows Pedro co-founded it, what you discussed last, and what's on your open threads. You didn't do anything — the brain already had it.

## Install

### Prerequisites

**Without Postgres**, you can use the GBrain knowledge model right now: the [skills](docs/GBRAIN_SKILLPACK.md), [schema](docs/GBRAIN_RECOMMENDED_SCHEMA.md), and compiled truth + timeline pattern work with any agent that reads and writes markdown files. Add Postgres when `grep` stops being enough.

**With Postgres**, GBrain needs three things:

| Dependency | What it's for | How to get it |
|------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Supabase account** | Postgres + pgvector database | [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) (Pro tier, $25/mo for 8GB) |
| **OpenAI API key** | Embeddings (text-embedding-3-large) | [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) |
| **Anthropic API key** | Multi-query expansion + LLM chunking (Haiku) | [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) |

Set the API keys as environment variables:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

The Supabase connection URL is configured during `gbrain init`. The OpenAI and Anthropic SDKs read their keys from the environment automatically.

Without an OpenAI key, search still works (keyword only, no vector search). Without an Anthropic key, search still works (no multi-query expansion, no LLM chunking).

### With OpenClaw (recommended)

To install, paste this into OpenClaw and we'll work with you to do the rest:

```
Set up gbrain (https://github.com/garrytan/gbrain) as my
knowledge brain.

1. Make sure bun is installed:
   curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
   Then run: bun add github:garrytan/gbrain

2. Run: gbrain init --supabase
   (follow the wizard to connect my Supabase database)

3. Scan ~/git/ and ~/Documents/ for markdown repos,
   pick the best one, and run: gbrain import <path> --no-embed

4. Run a query against the imported data to prove search works

5. Read docs/GBRAIN_RECOMMENDED_SCHEMA.md and offer to
   restructure my knowledge base

6. Read docs/GBRAIN_SKILLPACK.md and update all your skills
   with the production agent patterns: brain-agent loop,
   entity detection, source attribution, iron law back-linking,
   and the enrichment pipeline

7. Set up a daily cron for `gbrain check-update`.
   Notify me on new features only, not patches.
   Never auto-install, just tell me what's new.
```

OpenClaw will install gbrain, walk through Supabase setup, discover your markdown files, import them, and prove search works with a query from your data.

After setup, you talk to your brain through OpenClaw:

```
Search the brain for everything we know about [topic]
Ingest my meeting notes from today
Give me a briefing for my meetings tomorrow
How many pages are in the brain now?
```

GBrain keeps your brain current. After setup, `gbrain sync --watch` polls your git repo and imports only what changed. Binary files (images, PDFs, audio) can be moved to cloud storage with `gbrain files mirror` to slim down your git repo.

> **Supabase settings:** GBrain connects directly to Postgres (not the REST API).
> You need the **Shared Pooler connection string**, not the project URL or anon key.
> Find it: go to your project, click **Get Connected** next to the project URL,
> then **Direct Connection String** > **Session Pooler**, and copy the
> **Shared Pooler** connection string.

### GBrain without OpenClaw

GBrain works with any AI agent, any MCP client, or no agent at all. Three paths:

#### Standalone CLI

Install globally and use gbrain from the terminal:

```bash
bun add -g github:garrytan/gbrain
gbrain init --supabase          # guided wizard, connects to your Postgres
gbrain import ~/git/brain/      # index your markdown
gbrain query "what do we know about competitive dynamics?"
```

The CLI gives you every operation: page CRUD, search, tags, links, timeline, graph traversal, file management, health checks. Run `gbrain --help` for the full list.

#### MCP server (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.)

GBrain exposes 30 MCP tools via stdio. Add this to your MCP client config:

**Claude Code** (`~/.claude/server.json`):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gbrain": {
      "command": "gbrain",
      "args": ["serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Cursor** (Settings > MCP Servers):
```json
{
  "gbrain": {
    "command": "gbrain",
    "args": ["serve"]
  }
}
```

This gives your agent `get_page`, `put_page`, `search`, `query`, `add_link`, `traverse_graph`, `sync_brain`, `file_upload`, and 22 more tools. All generated from the same operation definitions as the CLI.

**The tools are not enough.** Your agent also needs the playbook: read [GBRAIN_SKILLPACK.md](docs/GBRAIN_SKILLPACK.md) and paste the relevant sections into your agent's system prompt or project instructions. The skillpack tells the agent WHEN and HOW to use each tool: read before responding, write after learning, detect entities on every message, back-link everything.

The skill markdown files in `skills/` are standalone instruction sets. Copy them into your agent's context:

| Skill file | What the agent learns |
|------------|----------------------|
| `skills/ingest/SKILL.md` | How to import meetings, docs, articles |
| `skills/query/SKILL.md` | 3-layer search with synthesis and citations |
| `skills/maintain/SKILL.md` | Periodic health: stale pages, orphans, dead links |
| `skills/enrich/SKILL.md` | Enrich pages from external APIs |
| `skills/briefing/SKILL.md` | Daily briefing with meeting prep |
| `skills/migrate/SKILL.md` | Migrate from Obsidian, Notion, Logseq, etc. |

#### As a TypeScript library

```bash
bun add github:garrytan/gbrain
```

```typescript
import { PostgresEngine } from 'gbrain';

const engine = new PostgresEngine();
await engine.connect({ database_url: process.env.DATABASE_URL });
await engine.initSchema();

// Search
const results = await engine.searchKeyword('startup growth');

// Read
const page = await engine.getPage('people/pedro-franceschi');

// Write
await engine.putPage('concepts/superlinear-returns', {
  type: 'concept',
  title: 'Superlinear Returns',
  compiled_truth: 'Paul Graham argues that returns in many fields are superlinear...',
  timeline: '- 2023-10-01: Published on paulgraham.com',
});
```

The `BrainEngine` interface is pluggable. See `docs/ENGINES.md` for how to add backends.

All paths require a Postgres database with pgvector. Supabase Pro ($25/mo) is the recommended zero-ops option.

## Upgrade

Upgrade depends on how you installed:

```bash
# Installed via bun (standalone or library)
bun update gbrain

# Installed via ClawHub
clawhub update gbrain

# Compiled binary
# Download the latest from https://github.com/garrytan/gbrain/releases
```

After upgrading, run `gbrain init` again to apply any schema migrations (idempotent, safe to re-run).

## Setup

After installing via CLI or library path, run the setup wizard:

```bash
# Guided wizard: auto-provisions Supabase or accepts a connection URL
gbrain init --supabase

# Or connect to any Postgres with pgvector
gbrain init --url postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/dbname
```

The init wizard:
1. Checks for Supabase CLI, offers auto-provisioning
2. Falls back to manual connection URL if CLI isn't available
3. Runs the full schema migration (tables, indexes, triggers, extensions)
4. Verifies the connection and confirms the database is ready for import

Config is saved to `~/.gbrain/config.json` with 0600 permissions.

OpenClaw users skip this step. The orchestrator runs the wizard for you during install.

## First import

```bash
# Import your markdown wiki (auto-chunks and auto-embeds)
gbrain import /path/to/brain/

# Skip embedding if you want to import fast and embed later
gbrain import /path/to/brain/ --no-embed

# Backfill embeddings for pages that don't have them
gbrain embed --stale
```

Import is idempotent. Re-running it skips unchanged files (compared by SHA-256 content hash). Progress bar shows status. ~30s for text import of 7,000 files, ~10-15 min for embedding.

## File storage and migration

Brain repos accumulate binary files: images, PDFs, audio recordings, raw API responses. A repo with 3,000 markdown pages might have 2GB of binaries making `git clone` painful.

GBrain has a three-stage migration lifecycle that moves binaries to cloud storage while preserving every reference:

```
Local files in git repo
  │
  ▼  gbrain files mirror <dir>
Cloud copy exists, local files untouched
  │
  ▼  gbrain files redirect <dir>
Local files replaced with .redirect breadcrumbs (tiny YAML pointers)
  │
  ▼  gbrain files clean <dir>
Breadcrumbs removed, cloud is the only copy
```

Every stage is reversible until `clean`:

```bash
# Stage 1: Copy to cloud (git repo unchanged)
gbrain files mirror ~/git/brain/attachments/ --dry-run   # preview first
gbrain files mirror ~/git/brain/attachments/

# Stage 2: Replace local files with breadcrumbs
gbrain files redirect ~/git/brain/attachments/ --dry-run
gbrain files redirect ~/git/brain/attachments/
# Your git repo just dropped from 2GB to 50MB

# Undo: download everything back from cloud
gbrain files restore ~/git/brain/attachments/

# Stage 3: Remove breadcrumbs (irreversible, cloud is the only copy)
gbrain files clean ~/git/brain/attachments/ --yes
```

**Storage backends:** S3-compatible (AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, MinIO), Supabase Storage, or local filesystem. Configured during `gbrain init`.

Additional file commands:

```bash
gbrain files list [slug]           # list files for a page (or all)
gbrain files upload <file> --page <slug>  # upload file linked to page
gbrain files sync <dir>            # bulk upload directory
gbrain files verify                # verify all uploads match local
gbrain files status                # show migration status of directories
gbrain files unmirror <dir>        # remove mirror marker (files stay in cloud)
```

The file resolver (`src/core/file-resolver.ts`) handles fallback automatically: if a local file is missing, it checks for a `.redirect` breadcrumb, then a `.supabase` marker, and resolves to the cloud URL. Code that references files by path keeps working after migration.

## The knowledge model

Every page in the brain follows the compiled truth + timeline pattern:

```markdown
---
type: concept
title: Do Things That Don't Scale
tags: [startups, growth, pg-essay]
---

Paul Graham's argument that startups should do unscalable things early on.
The most common: recruiting users manually, one at a time. Airbnb went
door to door in New York photographing apartments. Stripe manually
installed their payment integration for early users.

The key insight: the unscalable effort teaches you what users actually
want, which you can't learn any other way.

- 2025-02-20: Cited in discussion about AI agent onboarding strategies
```

Above the `---` separator: **compiled truth**. Your current best understanding. Gets rewritten when new evidence changes the picture. Below: **timeline**. Append-only evidence trail. Never edited, only added to.

The compiled truth is the answer. The timeline is the proof.

## How search works

```
Query: "when should you ignore conventional wisdom?"
         |
    Multi-query expansion (Claude Haiku)
    "contrarian thinking startups", "going against the crowd"
         |
    +----+----+
    |         |
  Vector    Keyword
  (HNSW     (tsvector +
  cosine)    ts_rank)
    |         |
    +----+----+
         |
    RRF Fusion: score = sum(1/(60 + rank))
         |
    4-Layer Dedup
    1. Best chunk per page
    2. Cosine similarity > 0.85
    3. Type diversity (60% cap)
    4. Per-page chunk cap
         |
    Stale alerts (compiled truth older than latest timeline)
         |
    Results
```

Keyword search alone misses conceptual matches. "Ignore conventional wisdom" won't find an essay titled "The Bus Ticket Theory of Genius" even though it's exactly about that. Vector search alone misses exact phrases when the embedding is diluted by surrounding text. RRF fusion gets both right. Multi-query expansion catches phrasings you didn't think of.

## Database schema

10 tables in Postgres + pgvector:

```
pages                    The core content table
  slug (UNIQUE)          e.g. "concepts/do-things-that-dont-scale"
  type                   person, company, deal, yc, civic, project, concept, source, media
  title, compiled_truth, timeline
  frontmatter (JSONB)    Arbitrary metadata
  search_vector          Trigger-based tsvector (title + compiled_truth + timeline + timeline_entries)
  content_hash           SHA-256 for import idempotency

content_chunks           Chunked content with embeddings
  page_id (FK)           Links to pages
  chunk_text             The chunk content
  chunk_source           'compiled_truth' or 'timeline'
  embedding (vector)     1536-dim from text-embedding-3-large
  HNSW index             Cosine similarity search

links                    Cross-references between pages
  from_page_id, to_page_id
  link_type              knows, invested_in, works_at, founded, references, etc.

tags                     page_id + tag (many-to-many)

timeline_entries         Structured timeline events
  page_id, date, source, summary, detail (markdown)

page_versions            Snapshot history for compiled_truth
  compiled_truth, frontmatter, snapshot_at

raw_data                 Sidecar JSON from external APIs
  page_id, source, data (JSONB)

files                    Binary attachments in Supabase Storage
  page_slug (FK)         Links to pages (ON UPDATE CASCADE)
  storage_path, content_hash, mime_type, metadata (JSONB)

ingest_log               Audit trail of import/ingest operations

config                   Brain-level settings (embedding model, chunk strategy, sync state)
```

Indexes: B-tree on slug/type, GIN on frontmatter/search_vector, HNSW on embeddings, pg_trgm on title for fuzzy slug resolution.

## Chunking

Three strategies, dispatched by content type:

**Recursive** (timeline, bulk import): 5-level delimiter hierarchy (paragraphs, lines, sentences, clauses, words). 300-word chunks with 50-word sentence-aware overlap. Fast, predictable, lossless.

**Semantic** (compiled truth): Embeds each sentence, computes adjacent cosine similarities, applies Savitzky-Golay smoothing to find topic boundaries. Falls back to recursive on failure. Best quality for intelligence assessments.

**LLM-guided** (high-value content, on request): Pre-splits into 128-word candidates, asks Claude Haiku to identify topic shifts in sliding windows. 3 retries per window. Most expensive, best results.

## Library and MCP details

See [GBrain without OpenClaw](#gbrain-without-openclaw) above for library usage examples, MCP server config, and skill file loading.

The `BrainEngine` interface is pluggable. See `docs/ENGINES.md` for how to add backends. 30 MCP tools are generated from the contract-first `operations.ts`. Parity tests verify structural identity between CLI, MCP, and tools-json.

## Skills

Fat markdown files that tell AI agents HOW to use gbrain. No skill logic in the binary.

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| **ingest** | Ingest meetings, docs, articles. Updates compiled truth (rewrite, not append), appends timeline, creates cross-reference links across all mentioned entities. |
| **query** | 3-layer search (keyword + vector + structured) with synthesis and citations. Says "the brain doesn't have info on X" rather than hallucinating. |
| **maintain** | Periodic health: find contradictions, stale compiled truth, orphan pages, dead links, tag inconsistency, missing embeddings, overdue threads. |
| **enrich** | Enrich pages from external APIs. Raw data stored separately, distilled highlights go to compiled truth. |
| **briefing** | Daily briefing: today's meetings with participant context, active deals with deadlines, time-sensitive threads, recent changes. |
| **migrate** | Universal migration from Obsidian (wikilinks to gbrain links), Notion (stripped UUIDs), Logseq (block refs), plain markdown, CSV, JSON, Roam. |
| **setup** | Set up GBrain from scratch: auto-provision Supabase via CLI, AGENTS.md injection, import, sync. Target TTHW < 2 min. |

## Engine Architecture

```
CLI / MCP Server
     (thin wrappers, identical operations)
              |
      BrainEngine interface
       (pluggable backend)
              |
     +--------+--------+
     |                  |
PostgresEngine     SQLiteEngine
  (ships v0)       (designed, community PRs welcome)
     |
Supabase Pro ($25/mo)
  Postgres + pgvector + pg_trgm
  connection pooling via Supavisor
```

Embedding, chunking, and search fusion are engine-agnostic. Only raw keyword search (`searchKeyword`) and raw vector search (`searchVector`) are engine-specific. RRF fusion, multi-query expansion, and 4-layer dedup run above the engine on `SearchResult[]` arrays.

## Storage estimates

For a brain with ~7,500 pages:

| Component | Size |
|-----------|------|
| Page text (compiled_truth + timeline) | ~150MB |
| JSONB frontmatter + indexes | ~70MB |
| Content chunks (~22K, text) | ~80MB |
| Embeddings (22K x 1536 floats) | ~134MB |
| HNSW index overhead | ~270MB |
| Links, tags, timeline, versions | ~50MB |
| **Total** | **~750MB** |

Supabase free tier (500MB) won't fit a large brain. Supabase Pro ($25/mo, 8GB) is the starting point.

Initial embedding cost: ~$4-5 for 7,500 pages via OpenAI text-embedding-3-large.
