# Skill Development Cycle

Never do one-off work. Everything repeatable becomes a durable skill.

## The Rule

**If you have to ask your agent for something twice, it should already be a
skill running on a cron.** First time is discovery. Second time is system failure.

## The 5-Step Cycle

### Step 1: Concept the Process

Describe what needs to happen in plain language:
- What's the input? What's the output? What triggers it?
- What data sources does it touch?
- How often should it run?

### Step 2: Run Manually for 3-10 Items

Actually do the work by hand on a small batch. This is the prototype phase.
Do NOT write a SKILL.md yet. Just do the work and observe:
- What does the output actually look like?
- What edge cases appear?
- What quality bar is right?

### Step 3: Evaluate Output

Show the user the results. Get feedback.
- Does output look good? Is quality right?
- Did you miss anything? Over-engineer?
- Revise the process based on what you learned.

### Step 4: Codify into a Skill

Write the SKILL.md. Either:
- **New skill** — genuinely new capability
- **Add to existing skill** — variation of something that exists (parameterize it)

The skill must be:
- **Durable** — works tomorrow, next week, next month without manual intervention
- **MECE** — doesn't overlap with other skills (see below)
- **Parameterized** — handles variations through parameters, not separate skills

### Step 5: Add to Cron (if recurring)

If the process should run automatically:
- Add to existing cron job if it fits naturally
- Create new cron job if it has a distinct scheduling concern
- Monitor the first 2-3 automated runs for quality
- Fix issues that emerge at scale

## MECE Discipline

Skills should be **Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive**:
- Each entity type has exactly ONE owner skill
- Each signal source has exactly ONE owner skill
- Two skills creating the same brain page = MECE violation

**Example ownership (no overlap):**

| Signal Source | Owner Skill | Creates |
|--------------|-------------|---------|
| Meeting transcripts | meeting-ingestion | brain/meetings/ pages |
| Email messages | executive-assistant | brain/people/ timeline entries |
| X/Twitter posts | x-collector | brain/media/ pages |
| Person enrichment | enrich | brain/people/ compiled truth |
| Calendar events | calendar-sync | brain/daily/calendar/ pages |
| Video/podcast content | media-ingest | brain/media/ pages |

## Quality Bar Checklist

A skill is ready when:

- [ ] Ran successfully on 3-10 real items with good output
- [ ] User reviewed output and approved
- [ ] SKILL.md is under 500 lines (use references for overflow)
- [ ] Checks notability before creating brain pages (don't create pages for nobodies)
- [ ] Has citation enforcement (every fact has a source)
- [ ] Doesn't overlap with existing skills (MECE)
- [ ] If recurring: on a cron with appropriate schedule
- [ ] If it creates brain pages: checks notability first

## What This Means in Practice

- Don't do ad-hoc brain enrichment, use the enrich skill
- Don't manually check social media, use an automated cron
- Don't manually ingest meeting notes, use the meeting-sync recipe
- Don't manually create entity pages, use the entity detector
- If a new pattern emerges, prototype it, skill-ify it, cron-ify it
